    "text": "Design and Data Collection\nAs a class, we went to the Fullerton Arboretum and identified the two flowers that we wanted to collect the data on. We split into pairs and collected four pieces of data on the two species: the number of rays on each flower, the diameter of the center disk, the diameter of the entire flower, and the stem length. Everything was measured in centimeters. We used a simple measuring ruler and recorded our data on a sheet of paper. The number of rays was counted individually. The diameter of the disk was measured through the center from end to end. The diameter of the entire flower was measured similarly to the disk but extended to include the rays. The stem length was measured from the bottom of the flower part of the plant to the first area that it branched off closest to the flower. Each pair measured 10 flowers of each species, so in total we got 50 of each species.\n\nA few limitations of the data collection was limited access. There were many flowers that could not be accessed due to the desire to respect the grounds and not create new and unnatural paths. A lot of the flowers were also close to more dangerous plants like cacti or in areas that were fenced off, so that limited the randomness of the collection. My partner and I decided to stay consistent with who was collecting the data. Since we did this, we tried to limit the variation in measuring judgement that may have occurred had we not stayed consistent, like deciding where the center of a flower was. Additionally, the measurements that we did were not always as accurate as we wanted them. The rulers only went so far in the parts to a whole so judgement in rounding could be different based on who did the measuring."

Explain what is going on in your graphs and summaries and how those insights relate to the models you will be building in the next section.\nDuring the Logistic Regression with Encelia activity, we created plots that compared each of the variables to the species that it was. We knew that there were some differences to the flowers, and we were able to pinpoint the main identifiers that were different.\n\n#disk diameter vs. species\nggplot(\n  data = encelia_train,\n  mapping = aes(x = disk_diameter, y=Species)\n  ) + \n  geom_jitter(height = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disk diameter is fairly similar for both flowers so it might not be as useful when creating our model. The model might get confused since there is not a significant difference.\n\n#number of rays vs. species\nggplot(\n  data = encelia_train,\n  mapping = aes(x = number_rays, y=Species)\n  ) + \n  geom_jitter(height = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the Encelia californica tended to have a higher number of rays than the Encelia farinosa, which is a known identifier for these species.\n\n#ray diameter vs. species\nggplot(\n  data = encelia_train,\n  mapping = aes(x = ray_diameter, y=Species)\n  ) + \n  geom_jitter(height = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ray diameter seems very similar for both flowers, but the average for the Encelia californica was higher overall.\n\n#stem length vs. species\nggplot(\n  data = encelia_train,\n  mapping = aes(x = stem_length, y=Species)\n  ) + \n  geom_jitter(height = 0.1)\n\nWarning: Removed 16 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStem length for the Encelia californica had a wider range than the Encelia farinosa. With this knowledge, we could see that most of the Encelia farinosa had overall smaller stem lengths which could help us identify for our model.\nAfter looking at these plots, we can see which variables might be the most important when helping our model predict the species. Before looking at the modeling, it seems like the stem length and ray diameter might be the biggest factors in predicting which species a flower is."
