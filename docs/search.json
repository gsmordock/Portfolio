They can be used to restore deserts and native gardens and help with erosion control. It is important that people understand the differences between the two species if they are trying to restore areas and need the correct plant to do so. When restoring areas, it is important that the plant can flourish properly in the environment it is placed in. One of the biggest differences are when they flower. The Encelia farinosa flowers from February to May then August to September while Encelia californica flowers from February to October. Another difference is the elevations and locations where they thrive. Encelia farinosa can go up to 1000 meters above sea level and thrives in more inland desert regions, while the Encelia californica can go up to 600 meters above sea level and is found in more coastal regions.\nThe Fullerton Arboretum focuses on conserving and displaying the beauty of plants in a local community area. The Arboretum works with California State University, Fullerton to provide students with the ability to learn, research and appreciate these plants and horticulture."

    "text": "Design and Data Collection\nAs a class, we went to the Fullerton Arboretum and identified the two flowers that we wanted to collect the data on. We split into pairs and collected four pieces of data on the two species: the number of rays on each flower, the diameter of the center disk, the diameter of the entire flower, and the stem length. Everything was measured in centimeters. We used a simple measuring ruler and recorded our data on a sheet of paper. The number of rays was counted individually. The diameter of the disk was measured through the center from end to end. The diameter of the entire flower was measured similarly to the disk but extended to include the rays. The stem length was measured from the bottom of the flower part of the plant to the first area that it branched off closest to the flower. Each pair measured 10 flowers of each species, so in total we got 50 of each species.\n\nA few limitations of the data collection was limited access. There were many flowers that could not be accessed due to the desire to respect the grounds and not create new and unnatural paths. A lot of the flowers were also close to more dangerous plants like cacti or in areas that were fenced off, so that limited the randomness of the collection. My partner and I decided to stay consistent with who was collecting the data. Since we did this, we tried to limit the variation in measuring judgement that may have occurred had we not stayed consistent, like deciding where the center of a flower was. Additionally, the measurements that we did were not always as accurate as we wanted them. The rulers only went so far in the parts to a whole so judgement in rounding could be different based on who did the measuring."
